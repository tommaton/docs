---

The MyXSpend API enables clients to process payments on behalf of their users. This guide outlines the key steps required to integrate with the MyXSpend platform and successfully process payments.

## Steps to Process Payments

### Step 1: Merchant Registration  
Sign up as a merchant at [MyXSpend Dashboard](https://myxspend.com/dashboard). This step creates an account for your organization.

### Step 2: KYC Verification  
MyXSpend will complete the **Know Your Customer (KYC)** verification process for your account. This step is mandatory before processing payments.

### Step 3: Configure PostBack URL  
Add your **PostBack URL** in the MyXSpend portal. This ensures MyXSpend sends transaction status updates to your system upon payment confirmation. Refer to [PostBack URL Documentation](/webhook/postback) for detailed integration steps.

### Step 4: Authenticate API Requests  
Use the [/auth/login`](/endpoint/auth/post) endpoint to authenticate your API calls. Upon successful authentication, this endpoint returns a **Bearer Token**, which must be included in all subsequent requests along with the API KEY and Company Id in the **Response Headers**

### Step 5: Process a Payment  
Use the [payment/process](/endpoint/payment/post) endpoint to initiate a payment transaction.

### Step 6: Include Required Headers and Bearer Token 
Ensure the following headers are included in requests to the [payment/process](/endpoint/payment/post) endpoint:

<Note>
  - **X-API-KEY**: Retrieved from the `/auth/login` response header.
  - **X-COMPANY-ID**: Retrieved from the `/auth/login` response header
</Note>

By following these steps, merchants can successfully integrate with MyXSpend and securely process payments.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
