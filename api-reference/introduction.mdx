# Processing Payments with MyXSpend API

## 1. Introduction
The MyXSpend API enables clients to process payments on behalf of their users. This guide outlines the key steps required to integrate with the MyXSpend platform and successfully process payments.

## 2. API Endpoint
Base API URL:  
`https://api.myxspend.com/v1/`

## 3. Steps to Process Payments

### Step 1: Merchant Registration  
Sign up as a merchant at [MyXSpend Dashboard](https://myxspend.com/dashboard). This step creates an account for your organization.

### Step 2: KYC Verification  
MyXSpend will complete the **Know Your Customer (KYC)** verification process for your account. This step is mandatory before processing payments.

### Step 3: Configure PostBack URL  
Add your **PostBack URL** in the MyXSpend portal. This ensures MyXSpend sends transaction status updates to your system upon payment confirmation. Refer to [PostBack URL Documentation](/webhook/postback) for detailed integration steps.

### Step 4: Authenticate API Requests  
Use the [/auth/login`](/endpoint/auth/post) endpoint to authenticate your API calls. Upon successful authentication, this endpoint returns a **Bearer Token**, which must be included in all subsequent requests.

### Step 5: Process a Payment  
Use the `/v1/payment/process` endpoint to initiate a payment transaction.

### Step 6: Include Required Headers  
Ensure the following headers are included in requests to the [payment/process](/endpoint/payment/post) endpoint:

<Note>
  - **X-API-KEY**: Retrieved from the `/login` response.
  - **X-COMPANY-ID**: Retrieved from the `/login` response.
</Note>

By following these steps, merchants can successfully integrate with MyXSpend and securely process payments.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
