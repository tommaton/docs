## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the steps to configure a PostBack URL within the MyXspend portal. A PostBack URL enables MyXspend to notify merchants about transaction status updates in real-time.

## 2. Overview

To receive transaction status updates via a postback request, merchants must configure their PostBack URL within the MyXspend portal. When a transaction reaches a terminal state, MyXspend will trigger an HTTP GET request to the specified PostBack URL, appending relevant query parameters.

### 2.1 PostBack URL Query Parameters

The following query parameters will be included in the GET request:

- **customerOrderId**: The unique transaction identifier provided by the merchant in the `/payment/process` API request.
- **status**: The final status of the transaction, which can be one of the following values:
  - `SUCCESSFUL`: Indicates that the transaction was completed successfully.
  - `EXPIRED`: Indicates that the transaction was not completed within the allowed time frame.
  - `FAILED`: Payment failed (e.g. invalid card, failed KYC).
- **dateTime**: The date of successful payment in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (GMT timezone). If the payment failed or expired, this will be `null`.
- **amount**: The amount paid by the user. This may differ from the amount in the original /process request if the merchant allows flexibility.
- **currency**: The currency in which the user paid. This may differ from the original currency in the /process request if the merchant accepts multiple currencies.

### 2.2 Important Considerations

- If a transaction status is `EXPIRED`, multiple callbacks may be received.
- The `SUCCESSFUL` status is definitive and will not change.
- Only HTTP GET requests are supported for PostBack URLs.
- **Order of Parameters Matters**: The query parameters must appear **in the exact order** shown above, and their **casing** must match exactly. This is critical for correct signature validation.
- **Signed as a String**: The full URL with parameters is treated as a single string before signing.

By properly configuring a PostBack URL, merchants can seamlessly receive and process transaction status updates, ensuring accurate order management and real-time status tracking.

### 2.3 How We Construct the Payload

We generate the signed payload by taking the **callback URL** you provided in the MyXspend portal and appending the following query parameters:

```
?customerOrderId={CUSTOMER_ORDER_ID}&status={STATUS}&dateTime={DATE}&amount={AMOUNT}&currency={CURRENCY}
```

### Example

If your registered callback URL is:

```
https://mycallbackurl.com/myxspend
```

#### ✅ Successful Payment

```
https://mycallbackurl.com/myxspend?customerOrderId=123456&status=SUCCESSFUL&dateTime=2025-05-29&amount=18.0&currency=EUR
```

#### ❌ Failed Payment

```
https://mycallbackurl/myxspend?customerOrderId=123456&status=FAILED&dateTime=null&amount=18
```

### 2.4 Signature Key

To ensure the security of our webhook calls, we sign each payload using the **HMAC-SHA256** algorithm and then encoded in Base64 format. The resulting signature is included in the `X-Signature` header of the webhook request.

We use your **API Key** to generate the signature. You can find your API Key either:

- On the **MyXspend Portal**, or
- In the response header of the **Login API** request.

### 2.5 Sample Code to construct Signature for Validation

```javascript
// Code Sample to generate signature header in Javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function createSigningHeader(queryString, apiKey) {
    // Create HMAC SHA-256 signature
    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', apiKey);
    hmac.update(queryString);
    const signatureBase64 = hmac.digest('base64');

    // Return header map
    return {
        'X-Signature': signatureBase64
    };
}

// Example usage:
const postBackUri = "https://mycallbackurl.com/myxspend?customerOrderId=123456&status=SUCCESSFUL&dateTime=2025-05-29&amount=18.0&currency=EUR";

const headers = createSigningHeader(postBackUri, 'YOUR_API_KEY');
console.log(headers);
```

```php
// Code Sample to generate signature header in php
function createSigningHeader($queryString, $apiKey) {
    // Create HMAC SHA-256 signature
    $hmac = hash_hmac('sha256', $queryString, $apiKey, true);

    // Encode in Base64
    $signatureBase64 = base64_encode($hmac);

    // Return header array
    return [
        'X-Signature' => $signatureBase64
    ];
}

// Example usage:
$postBackUri = 'https://mycallbackurl.com/myxspend?customerOrderId=123456&status=SUCCESSFUL&dateTime=2025-05-29&amount=18.0&currency=EUR';

$headers = createSigningHeader($postBackUri, 'YOUR_API_KEY');
print_r($headers);
```
