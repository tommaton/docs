title: 'Implementing PostBackUrl in MyXspend'

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the steps to configure a PostBack URL within the MyXspend portal. A PostBack URL enables MyXspend to notify merchants about transaction status updates in real-time.

## 2. Overview
To receive transaction status updates via a postback request, merchants must configure their PostBack URL within the MyXspend portal. When a transaction reaches a terminal state, MyXspend will trigger an HTTP GET request to the specified PostBack URL, appending relevant query parameters.

### 2.1 PostBack URL Query Parameters
The following query parameters will be included in the GET request:

- **customerOrderId**: The unique transaction identifier provided by the merchant in the `/payment/process` API request.
- **status**: The final status of the transaction, which can be one of the following values:
  - `SUCCESSFUL`: Indicates that the transaction was completed successfully.
  - `EXPIRED`: Indicates that the transaction was not completed within the allowed time frame.
- **dateTime**: The timestamp of the final status update in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).

### 2.2 Important Considerations
- If a transaction status is `EXPIRED`, multiple callbacks may be received.
- The `SUCCESSFUL` status is definitive and will not change.
- Only HTTP GET requests are supported for PostBack URLs.

By properly configuring a PostBack URL, merchants can seamlessly receive and process transaction status updates, ensuring accurate order management and real-time status tracking.
